Description: We implement causal decomposition analysis using the methods proposed by Park, Lee, and Qin (2020) <arXiv:2008.12812> and Park, Kang, and Lee (2021+). This package allows researchers to use the multiple-mediator-imputation, single-mediator-imputation, and product-of-coefficients regression methods to estimate the initial disparity, disparity reduction, and disparity remaining. It also allows to make the inference conditional on baseline covariates.
